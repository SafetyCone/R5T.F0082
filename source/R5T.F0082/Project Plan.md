Code file system survey functionality.

Starting with a set of repositories directory paths, functionality in this library allows querying the a file-system to find:

* Repository directory paths
* Solution directory paths
* Solution file paths
* Project directory paths
* Project file paths

Repositories directory paths are the paths of directories containing many repository sub-directories.

A good way to organize code is:

C:\Code\DEV\Git\GitHub\{GitHub User}\{Repository Name}\

This is the directory path for code, that is in development (not production), that is accessed using the Git protocol (not SVN), from the GitHub remote repository source (not SourceForge or etc.), for a particular GitHub user's repository, for a particular repository.

In this example, the repositories directory path would be:

C:\Code\DEV\Git\GitHub\{GitHub User}\
